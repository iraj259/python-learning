Day 1 was all about basic knowledge like syntax, variable, data types, operators, and comments.

Day 2 was all about conditionals and loops.

Day 3 was all about nested loops.

Day 4 was all about break, continue statements and built in functions.

Day 5 was all about built in modules, strings, indexing and slicing of strings.

Day 6 is all about functions in strings.
Some are common functions like len(), max(), min(), sorted() etc. They are used for other data types as well.
Some are string specific functions like capitalize/title.lower/upper/swap case

Day 7 is all about the lists. Lists are heterogenous(different data types can be stored unlike arrays that are homogenous).
List do not store stuff in a line or in a sequence of memory address whereas arrays store in a seq of memory address which is why they are faster.
Lists are programmer friendly.
Lists are mutable.
Tuples are immutable unlike lists.
Sets do not allow duplicates, no indexing,slicing,no editing, no mutable data type whereas set itself is mutable.
sets follow hashing
Dictionary is a collection of key value pairs.
It has no indexing, is a mutable data type but keys are immutable and values are mutable. Keys should be unique.

Mutable->list/sets/dictionary
Immutable->strings/tuples/int/float/boolean/complex

Day 8 was all about theory and learning abut variable and memory references.
Functions is a block of code with a purpose.
Functions has abstraction-mean does not matter what the code is, main motive is ti run and get the desired output. Decomposition is like many diff small functions combined to make the desired thing.

Day 9 was all about more function questions.

Day 10 was about functions again.
In arguments there are two types of arguments:
1. Positional arguments->arguments are passed in the order they are defined in the function.
2. Keyword arguments->arguments are passed by name.
